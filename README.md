# Boiler plate - MEAN stack

## Why this boilerplate ?

MEAN is an acronym for MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS and Node.js. Here is a MEAN boilerplate that I will use later in a few projects, to accelerate and simplify development.

## How to use it ?

### Install dependencies

npm install

### Start the server

npm start

### Watch the result

localhost:0000 (the PORT number defined in the .env file)
